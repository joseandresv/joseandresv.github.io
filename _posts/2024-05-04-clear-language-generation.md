### Spanish Language Simplification, 2023 - 2024

As my thesis proyect *(scientific article in reality)*, I looked for a problem deeply connected with one of my biggest desires and dreams in life; for all people to be able to understand each other.

In order to get us closer to that goal, I proposed the utilization of Causal LMs for the task of Language Simplification. LS is one of the oldest problems in NLP, and is also one of the main avenues of investigation. You can see a little bit more of the background of this task in my test trial article.

- LLM for Plain Language Tasks (PLTs)
- QLoRA utilized for fine-tuning.
- Data Analysis and Agumentation with NLP techniques.
- Prompt Engineering for Instruction Tuning of Causal LMs
- Evaluation of SOTA LLMs for Language Simplification (Llama2 vs Gemma vs T5).
