NLP focused MSc in Computer Science with a fervent interest in leveraging cutting-edge Large Language Models (LLMs) and advanced techniques to drive innovative projects. Possessing a robust background in Computer Science and Data Science, I am particularly passionate about applying my expertise to NLP-focused initiatives, aiming to push the boundaries of language understanding and generation by solving complex problems through interdisciplinary approache

### Data Science Projects

- **Clear Language Classification, 2023 - Ongoing**
  - *Thesis:* Developed a Multi-head LLM tailored for Plain Language Tasks (PLTs) - QLoRA utilized for fine-tuning.
  - Conducted RAG Dataset Creation from PL Documentation, employing Text Classification and Generation techniques, followed by comprehensive LLM evaluations (API GPT-4 vs Llama2 vs T5).
- **Cloud Home Theater PC, 2023 - Ongoing**
  - *Business Enterprise:* Spearheaded the development of an Amazon EC2 mounted application facilitating video file sharing, with an emphasis on application containerization for streamlined server execution.
- **Sarcasm vs Short Jokes Analysis, 2022**
  - *Data Analysis from NL:* Utilized NLTK and Spacy for Natural Language Processing (NLP) in the Statistical Analysis of Text, aimed at generating valuable insights.
- **Bird Population Clustering, 2022**
  - *Geospatial ML:* Implemented K-nearest neighbors (KNN) and Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) algorithms for spatial data clustering of Mexican Birds.

### Diverse Thoughts on Language and DS/CS

- *Everything is Language: World representation from a theory of language perspective.*
- *Will Theory: A model for understanding the Will-Desire-Action system.*
- *The Language Problem: Natural difficulties in communication and possible solutions.*
